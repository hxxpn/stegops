# Stegops: small library for your secrets

This is my small project aimed at rekindling my love and passion for programming.
Also, I want to explore aspects of following subjects:
- digital image processing
- information theory
- steganograpy
- bit manipulation and parsing binary files with python

The idea is to make a small method for inserting a bunch of text into images without it being noticeable.
Further steps could be in making the text resistant to compressions and format conversions.


### Tasks and steps

The split is between finger work and brain work. Manual labor and intellectual labor.
Generally we can sort tasks according to the finger work to brain work ratio. Regarding the time investment.

#### Finger work

> tasks that require little thinking, just manual effort
- [ ] write a method for opening BMP images and validating the fields

#### Brain work

> tasks that require research and learning new things

- [ ] reading files in python, experiment with different modes
- [ ] BMP image structure
- [ ] bytes in python, how to use offsets and how to decode and check data
- [ ] steganography methods, research how to embed and retrieve text
